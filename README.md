Bank Loan Case Study

# Data Analytics Tasks:

A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.
Graph suggestion: Create a bar chart or column chart to visualize the proportion of missing values for each variable.

B. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.
Graph suggestion: Create box plots or scatter plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables and highlight the outliers.

C. Analyze Data Imbalance: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.
Graph suggestion: Create a pie chart or bar chart to visualize the distribution of the target variable and highlight the class imbalance.

D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.
Graph suggestion: Create histograms, bar charts, or box plots to visualize the distributions of variables. Create stacked bar charts or grouped bar charts to compare variable distributions across different scenarios. Create scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize the relationships between variables and the target variable.

E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
Graph suggestion: Create correlation matrices or heatmaps to visualize the correlations between variables within each segment. Highlight the top correlated variables for each scenario using different colors or shading.
